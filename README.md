# DorkDb
Just a quick exercise in writing code so that I do not turn into a manager.

## Native
Written in C, not done yet.  Maybe will finish sometime.

## Erlang
To run:
```
brew install erlang
make
erl
Eshell V6.3  (abort with ^G)
1> dork:repl().
dork>
```
Now you can enter commands as you might expect.  Sorry, can't read from files and REPL is in erlang shell.
